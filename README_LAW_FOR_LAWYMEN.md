### 1. **Adding Legal Documents**

Upload your legal documents through the web interface or programmatically:

```python
import asyncio
from lightrag import LightRAG
from lightrag.llm.openai import gpt_4o_mini_complete, openai_embed

async def add_legal_document():
    rag = LightRAG(
        working_dir="./legal_rag_storage",
        embedding_func=openai_embed,
        llm_model_func=gpt_4o_mini_complete
    )
    
    await rag.initialize_storages()
    
    # Add legal content
    with open("tenant_rights_guide.txt", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    await rag.ainsert(content)
    await rag.finalize_storages()

asyncio.run(add_legal_document())
```

### 2. **Asking Legal Questions**

Use natural language to ask legal questions:

**Examples:**
- "What are my rights as a tenant?"
