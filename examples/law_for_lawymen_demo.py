Law for Lawymen - South Africa Demo Script

This script demonstrates how to use the customized LightRAG system for South African legal 
document analysis and plain-language legal guidance. It shows how to:

1. Initialize the South African legal RAG system
2. Insert South African legal documents and content
3. Query the system with common South African legal questions
4. Get plain-language explanations of South African legal concepts

Usage:
    python examples/law_for_lawymen_demo.py

Requirements:
    - Set your OpenAI API key in the .env file
    - Ensure the legal_prompts.py module is available

    3. Consideration: Something of value exchanged (money, services, goods)
    4. Legal Capacity: Parties must be legally able to enter contracts
    5. Legal Purpose: Contract cannot be for illegal activities

    Types of Contracts:

    - Material terms: Essential elements (price, delivery, specifications)
    - Conditions: Requirements that must be met
    - Warranties: Promises about quality or performance

    Breach of Contract:
    A breach occurs when one party fails to perform their obligations. Types include:

    - Rescission: Contract is cancelled and parties restored to original position
    - Reformation: Contract terms are modified to reflect true agreement

    - Fraud: One party was deceived
    - Duress: One party was forced to agree
